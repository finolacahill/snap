Snap can be played with 2, 3 or 4 players,
all you need is a keyboard! Each player 
will be assigned a Snap key, when you hit
that key on the keyboard, you’re saying 
“Snap!”. If the card you snapped on is the 
same as the previous card, you win the 
pile. If you’re wrong, the pile is 
distributed amongst your opponents.
When it’s your turn, use the spacebar to 
turn over a new card. The last player
with cards wins.

You can play with between 2 and 6 decks,
the more decks you play with the longer 
the game and the more opportunities to 
snap! 

Hit the “start” button to start a new
