In the src folder there is a Snap.jar, double click to play! Please note
that if Snap.jar is moved from the src folder, it will not be able to
find the graphic resources necessary for the best game experience.

Alternatively Main.java can be found in the controller package, and
run from an IDE such as eclipse or Intellij by hitting the run button.

If you would like to run the game from the command line, the .java
files are pre-compiled and ready in the classes folder. From the snap
folder type:
“java -cp classes controller.Main”

Please note the Junit tests are not pre-compiled. They will need to
compiled if you would like to run them from the command line, they can
be found in the tests folder in the src folder. Alternatively they can
be run from Eclipse or any other IDE.

In order to play the game, all you need is a keyboard! You can play with 
between 2 and 4 players, each player will have their own assigned "snap" 
key, and the spacebar is used to turn cards. The player who wins is the 
last player with cards in their hand. See the help screen in the game for
further game details.
